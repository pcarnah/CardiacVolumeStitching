# CardiacVolumeStitching

Slicer modules used for generated multi-view compounded volumes from TEE images. Requires 1 or more mid-esophageal views and 4 or more transgastric views with approximately 80% overlap between volumes.

Complete package can be found in Releases.

Development requires SimpleElastix fork found at: https://github.com/pcarnah/SimpleElastix
For use of SimpleElastix in Slicer you can also build this fork of SlicerElastix that satisfies this dependency: https://github.com/pcarnah/SlicerElastix


Future plans will include SimpleElastix with this build for simplicity.
